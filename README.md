# CNCF Webinar: Enabling WebAssembly workloads in Kubernetes

WebAssembly is a lightweight and portable bytecode format that executes in a secure sanboxed runtime. Originally created for the browser, it has been adapted in recent years for server-side applications by taking advantage of the WASI specification. Kubernetes provides a rich ecosystem of tools and integrations that can be leveraged to manage, monitor, and scale applications. By embracing WebAssembly, developers can tap into the extensive Kubernetes ecosystem to create resource-efficient applications that scale effortlessly and fit seemlessly into existing environments.

## Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl
- helm
- spin
- rust & wasm32-wasi target
- golang & tinygo
- node & npm
